Welcome to alof-lib's documentation!
====================================

AlofLib is a PHP library to provide some util functions to array-like objects:
- Implements Traversable
- Implements ArrayAccess

While PHPDoc doc-blocks contain the latest documentation about the library,
there was an unsuccessful attempt to produce ReadTheDocs documentation.
If you know how to build ReadTheDoc documentation from PHPDoc doc-blocks, then you are most welcome to make a PR!
